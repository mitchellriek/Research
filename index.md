# + Mitchell Riek 

I am a third year Bachelor's student, pursuing a degree in Mechanical engineering from Carnegie Mellon Univeristy. My interests include, Biomedical applications for stretchable electronics, and Solid Mechanics.

## Current Project

- Strain Acitvated Actuators

My research involves studying how the out of plane deformations caused by tension buckling can be manipulated to create deformations applicabale to biomedical engineering (eg. Mirconeedle arrays, Microsutures).

## Scholarship and Awards

- Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship Award (SURF)
